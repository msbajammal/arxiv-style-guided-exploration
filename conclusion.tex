\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We showed that structural and visual stylistic cues
can aid exploring web apps' event space through crawling.
In particular, our machine learning models
trained on around 700,000 web elements from 1,000 real-world websites
can achieve a high accuracy
in identifying actionables:
90.14\% precision and 87.76\% recall 
when considering the click event listener,
and on average, 
75.42\% precision and 77.76\% recall 
when considering
the five most-frequent event types.
We also devised a technique for ranking actionables
in a crawling session based on stylistic cues.
We concluded that our technique can improve
the \js code coverage achieved by a general-purpose crawler that is tailored for highly-dynamic web apps.

One important direction of future work is to investigate the possibility of 
training machine learning models
for other event types
which are widely used in certain web apps,
e.g., drag and drop.
In addition, we believe that stylistic cues
should be taken into account for
improving other aspects of crawling,
e.g., 
for devising state abstraction functions
that incorporate changes in \css styles.
