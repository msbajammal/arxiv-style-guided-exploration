\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

We automated our data collection using Chrome DevTool protocol's
open-source implementation in Java (\textsc{cdp4j}~\cite{chrome-dev-tools-java}).
We trained the machine learning models
using \textsc{R}~\cite{r}.
We used the implementation of C5.0 model in R~\cite{c50}
as the final classifier,
as it showed the best results in our evaluation.

We developed \toolName,
a tool that extends a general-purpose crawler, namely \crawljax~\cite{Mesbah:2012:Crawljax}, 
which is tailored for exploring highly dynamic web apps. \toolName enhances \crawljax's \textit{candidate actionables strategy}
by incorporating the trained models
to better identify actionables,
and also by ranking the actionables 
using stylistic cues
to improve state exploration.

To deploy the trained models from R to Java,
we used rJava~\cite{rjava}, which allows communicating with the R environment from Java.
All the developed tools, 
collected data for training,
evaluation results, 
and the training/testing data are available online~\cite{experimental-data}.
