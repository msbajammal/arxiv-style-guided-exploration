In this paper we present an architecture and a set of related techniques for accessing the information placed in web pages with support for client-side dynamism, dealing with aspects such as JavaScript technology, non-standard session maintenance mechanisms, client redirections,Â pop-up menus, etc. Our approach leverages current browser APIs and implements novel crawling models and algorithms.",

To that end, we accomplish several tasks. First, we perform a thorough analysis of the different client-side technologies and the main features of the Web 2.0 pages in order to determine the initial levels of the aforementioned scale. Second, we submit a Web site whose purpose is to check what crawlers are capable of dealing with those technologies and features. Third, we propose several methods to evaluate the performance of the crawlers in the Web site and to classify them according to the levels of the scale. Fourth, we show the results of applying those methods to some OpenSource and commercial crawlers, as well as to the robots of the main Web search engines.",

	abstract="New web application development technologies such as Ajax, Flex or Silverlight result in so-called Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) that provide enhanced responsiveness, but introduce new challenges for crawling that cannot be addressed by the traditional crawlers. This paper describes a novel crawling technique for RIAs. The technique first generates an optimal crawling strategy for an anticipated model of the crawled RIA by aiming at discovering new states as quickly as possible. As the strategy is executed, if the discovered portion of the actual model of the application deviates from the anticipated model, the anticipated model and the strategy are updated to conform to the actual model. We compare the performance of our technique to a number of existing ones as well as depth-first and breadth-first crawling on some Ajax test applications. The results show that our technique has a better performance often with a faster rate of state discovery.",

	abstract="Crawling ``classical'' web applications is a problem that has been addressed more than a decode ago. Efficient crawling of web applications that use advanced technologies such as AJAX (called Rich Internet Applications, RIAs) is still an open problem. Crawling is important not only for indexing content, but also for building models of the applications, which is necessary for automated testing, automated security and accessibility assessments and in general for using software engineering tools. This paper presents a new strategy to crawl RIAs. It uses the concept of Model-Based Crawling (MBC) first introduced in [1], and introduces a new model, the ``menu model'', which we show to be much simpler than previous models for MBC and more effective at building models than previously published methods. This method and others are compared against a set of experimental and real RIAs.",

Traditional crawling techniques are not sufficient for crawling RIAs. We present a new strategy for crawling RIAs. This new strategy is designed based on the concept of ``Model-Based Crawling'' introduced in [3] and uses statistics accumulated during the crawl to select what to explore next with a high probability of uncovering some new information. The performance of our strategy is compared with our previous strategy, as well as the classical Breadth-First and Depth-First on two real RIAs and two test RIAs. The results show this new strategy is significantly better than the Breadth-First and the Depth-First strategies (which are widely used to crawl RIAs), and outperforms our previous strategy while being much simpler to implement.",

	abstract="Crawling web applications is important for indexing, accessibility and security assessment. Crawling traditional web applications is an old problem, for which good and efficient solution are known. Crawling Rich Internet Applications (RIA) quickly and efficiently, however, is an open problem. Technologies such as AJAX and partial Document Object Model (DOM) updates only make the problem of crawling RIA more time consuming to the web crawler. One way to reduce the time to crawl a RIA is to crawl a RIA in parallel with multiple computers. Previously published Dist-RIA Crawler presents a distributed breath-first search algorithm to crawl RIAs. This paper expands Dist-RIA Crawler in two ways. First, it introduces an adaptive load-balancing algorithm that enables the crawler to learn about the speed of the nodes and adapt to changes, thus better utilize the resources. Second, it present a distributed greedy algorithm to crawl a RIA in parallel, called GDist-RIA Crawler. The GDist-RIA Crawler uses a server-client architecture where the server dispatched crawling jobs to the crawling clients. This paper illustrates a prototype implementation of the GDist-RIA Crawler, explains some of the techniques used to implement the prototype and inspects empirical performance measurements.",

	abstract="Crawling Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) is important to ensure their security, accessibility and to index them for searching. To crawl a RIA, the crawler has to reach every application state and execute every application event. On a large RIA, this operation takes a long time. Previously published GDist-RIA Crawler proposes a distributed architecture to parallelize the task of crawling RIAs, and run the crawl over multiple computers to reduce time. In GDist-RIA Crawler, a centralized unit calculates the next task to execute, and tasks are dispatched to worker nodes for execution. This architecture is not scalable due to the centralized unit which is bound to become a bottleneck as the number of nodes increases. This paper extends GDist-RIA Crawler and proposes a fully peer-to-peer and scalable architecture to crawl RIAs, called PDist-RIA Crawler. PDist-RIA doesn't have the same limitations in terms scalability while matching the performance of GDist-RIA. We describe a prototype showing the scalability and performance of the proposed solution.",

	abstract="Automatic crawling of Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) is a challenge because client-side code modifies the client dynamically, fetching server-side data asynchronously. Most existing solutions model RIAs as state machines with DOMs as states and JavaScript events execution as transitions. This approach fails when used with ``real-life'', complex RIAs, because the size of the produced model is much too large to be practical. In this paper, we propose a new method to crawl AJAX-based RIAs in an efficient manner by detecting ``components'', which are areas of the DOM that are independent from each other, and by crawling each component separately. This leads to a dramatic reduction of the required state space for the model, without loss of content coverage. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the RIA nor predefined definition of components. Instead, we infer the components by observing the behavior of the RIA during crawling. Our experimental results show that our method can index quickly and completely industrial RIAs that are simply out of reach for traditional methods.",

	abstract="Rich Internet Applications are widely used as they are interactive and user friendly. Automated tools for crawling Rich Internet Applications have become needed for many reasons such as content indexing or testing for correctness and security. Due to the large size of RIAs, distributed crawling has been introduced to reduce the amount of time required for crawling. However, having one controller may result in a performance bottleneck resulting from a single database simultaneously accessed by many crawlers. It may also be vulnerable to complete data loss if a node failure occurs at the storage unit. We present a distributed decentralized scheme for crawling large-scale RIAs capable of partitioning the search space among several controllers in which the information is partially stored, which allows for fault tolerance and for the scalability of the system. Our results are significantly better than for non-distributed crawling, and outperforms the distributed crawling using one coordinator.",

	abstract="Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) have been widely used in the web over the last decade as they were found to be responsive and user friendly compared to traditional web applications. Distributed RIA crawling has been introduced with the aim of decreasing the crawling time due to the large size of RIAs. However, the current RIA crawling systems do not allow for tolerance to failures that occur in one of their components. In this paper, we address the resilience problem when crawling RIAs in a distributed environment and we introduce an efficient RIA crawling system that is fault tolerant. Our approach is to partition the RIA model that results from the crawling over several storage devices in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. This makes the distributed data structure invulnerable to the single point of failure. We introduce three data recovery mechanisms for crawling RIAs in an unreliable environment: The Retry, the Redundancy and the Combined mechanisms. We evaluate the performance of the recovery mechanisms and their impact on the crawling performance through analytical reasoning.",

	abstract="Web applications are everywhere---well tested web applications however are in short supply. The mixture of JavaScript, HTML and CSS in a variety of different browsers makes it virtually impossible to apply static analysis techniques. In this setting, systematic testing becomes a real challenge. We present a technique to automatically generate tests for WebÂ 2.0 applications. Our approach systematically explores and tests all distinct functions of a web application. Our prototype implementation WEBMATE handles interfaces as complex as Facebook and is able to cover up to 7 times as much code as existing tools. The only requirements to use WEBMATE are the address of the application and, if necessary, user name and password.",
