\begin{abstract}

A wide range of analysis and testing techniques
targeting modern web apps 
rely on the automated exploration of their state space
by firing events that mimic user interactions. However, finding out which elements are actionable in web apps is not a trivial task.
To improve the efficacy 
of exploring the event space of web apps,
we propose a browser-independent,
instrumentation-free 
approach based on structural and visual stylistic cues.
Our approach, implemented in a tool called \toolName, 
 employs machine learning models,  
trained on 700,000 web elements from 1,000 real-world websites, 
to predict actionable elements on a webpage a priori.
In addition, our approach uses stylistic cues
for ranking these actionable elements
while exploring the app.
Our actionable predictor models achieve
90.14\% precision and 87.76\% recall 
when considering the click event listener,
and on average, 
75.42\% precision and 77.76\% recall 
when considering
the five most-frequent event types.
Our evaluations show that
\toolName can improve
the \js code coverage achieved by a general-purpose crawler
by up to 23\%.
